# PDF RAG Pipeline API - Question Description

## Overview

Build a production-ready FastAPI-based PDF document processing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines Google's Gemini AI models with FAISS vector database for intelligent document analysis. This project demonstrates how to create scalable document processing APIs, implement semantic search capabilities, and integrate multiple AI services into a cohesive web application.

## Project Objectives

1. **FastAPI Web Framework Integration:** Create a modern, high-performance REST API using FastAPI with automatic OpenAPI documentation, request validation, and error handling.

2. **PDF Document Processing Pipeline:** Implement robust PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF, intelligent text chunking with overlap, and automated document preprocessing for optimal AI analysis.

3. **Vector Database Implementation:** Build a FAISS-based vector storage system for high-dimensional embeddings with persistent storage, similarity search, and efficient indexing capabilities.

4. **AI-Powered Document Analysis:** Integrate Google Gemini models for both embedding generation (3072 dimensions) and response generation, creating a complete RAG pipeline for document understanding.

5. **Production API Design:** Implement comprehensive API endpoints with proper HTTP methods, status codes, request/response models, and interactive documentation.

6. **Error Handling and Validation:** Build robust error management systems that handle file upload failures, API errors, and invalid requests with meaningful error responses.

## Key Features to Implement

- FastAPI application with automatic OpenAPI documentation and Swagger UI integration
- PDF file upload and processing endpoints with proper file validation and error handling
- Vector embedding generation using Google Gemini embedding model with batch processing capabilities
- FAISS vector database operations including indexing, persistence, and similarity search
- Context-aware response generation using retrieved document chunks and Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Comprehensive API testing suite with real HTTP requests and endpoint validation
- Production-ready configuration management with environment variables and settings
- CORS middleware and proper HTTP status code handling for web application integration

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **FastAPI Architecture:** Understanding modern web framework patterns including dependency injection, middleware, and automatic documentation generation
- **PDF Processing:** Handling binary file uploads, text extraction from complex document formats, and managing file processing errors
- **Vector Database Operations:** Working with high-dimensional embeddings, similarity search algorithms, and persistent vector storage
- **AI Service Integration:** Coordinating multiple AI services (embedding and generation) with proper error handling and response processing
- **API Design Patterns:** Creating RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods, status codes, and request/response validation
- **Production Deployment:** Implementing configuration management, logging, error handling, and testing for production-ready applications
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Handling file uploads and processing with FastAPI's async capabilities

## Expected Outcome

You will create a complete PDF RAG system that can accept PDF uploads via REST API, process them into searchable embeddings, and provide intelligent question-answering capabilities. The system will demonstrate professional API development practices including proper documentation, testing, and error handling.

## Additional Considerations

- Implement batch document processing for handling multiple PDF files simultaneously
- Add support for different document formats beyond PDF (DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- Create advanced search features with filtering, ranking, and metadata-based queries
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed documents and embeddings
- Add authentication and authorization for secure document access
- Consider implementing streaming responses for large document processing operations
- Extend the system with document management features like versioning and categorization
